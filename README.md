# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_SUPPLY_CHAIN_DATA                                                  

As part of my analysis of supply chain data, I conducted a detailed evaluation of product categories, sales performance, customer demographics, logistics, and transportation costs. The dataset was carefully examined by identifying gaps in market saturation, regional supply chain inefficiencies, and quality concerns. Key financial relationships such as revenue generation, manufacturing costs, and shipping expenses were analyzed to pinpoint optimization opportunities. The analysis provided valuable insights into inventory management, demand-based pricing strategies, and transportation efficiency, helping to identify areas where startups could bridge market gaps. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in data-driven decision-making, supply chain optimization, and business opportunity identification. The findings can be further explored for strategic market expansion and startupÂ development.
